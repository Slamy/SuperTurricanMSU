-------------------- Super Turrican MSU Hack v0.3 -----------------------

This hack does not include the ROM file. You need to get a ROM of the European or the US version and patch it.


Expected MD5SUM of original ROMs to be sure you got the right thing.

  90c9fe8386a7f69de475c58bb8de01f7  Super Turrican (Europe).sfc
  24d31806dd79e6e2be36ef27b51c8858  Super Turrican (USA).sfc

Expected MD5SUMs of patched ROMs to be sure the patcher worked correctly:

  5de9480b3f6d2bc8e3a820e09f1a3240  supertur_msu1_ntsc_higan.sfc
  1e4c16230d253f690a8e24fb3a713337  supertur_msu1_ntsc_sd2snes.sfc
  64395b18887e44baa68d631a2b2955f4  supertur_msu1_pal_higan.sfc
  1426ad3f3de5344d7002efd17199cf03  supertur_msu1_pal_sd2snes.sfc



Patch the ROM file using JIPS or similar software to get the expected ROM file.


For SD2SNES:

It's very important that the patched ROM is renamed to supertur_msu1.sfc.
Put the *.pcm files, the *.sfc file and the *.msu file in one folder of your sd2snes.
Start the game and enjoy!


For Higan:

Put the *.pcm files, the *.sfc file, the *.msu file and manifest.bml in one folder.
Rename the *.sfc file to program.rom.
Add the game to the library of higan.

--Known Bugs--
During the title screen the cursor usually blinks. On a real SNES it doesn't do that until you move it. (only affects NTSC version)
There is a nasty glitch in the original game that i couldn't fix. On 1chip SNES models the SPC can crash under certain conditions.
Sound effects are gone and replaced by an irritating noise.
If this happens you are out of luck as most there is a high chance the game will not load the next world so this glitch is game breaking.

  
--Disclaimer--
Please keep in mind that you get this software package as is. If it damages your hardware and/or gives you a heart attack while playing do not blame me.
