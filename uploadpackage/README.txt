 

-------------------- Super Turrican Soundfix v0.1 -----------------------

This hack does not include the ROM file. You need to get a ROM of
the European or the US version and patch it.

Expected MD5SUM of original ROMs to be sure you got the right thing.

90c9fe8386a7f69de475c58bb8de01f7  Super Turrican (Europe).sfc
24d31806dd79e6e2be36ef27b51c8858  Super Turrican (USA).sfc

Expected MD5SUMs of patched ROMs to be sure the patcher worked correctly:

f91024b809d87d285c148b8a04f179ec  SuperTurricanSoundFix_NTSC.sfc
5d214342d2eb3beae115471e4dbc1a6e  SuperTurricanSoundFix_PAL.sfc


Patch the ROM file using Flips or similar software to get the expected ROM file.
